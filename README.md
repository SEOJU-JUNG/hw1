When doing this homework, I was inspired by peach flavor jelly.  
- SIZE:   I changed the circle radius like this: random(70, 110)
- MOTION:  Rather making the bubbles' motion dramatic, I made the bubbles' size getting bigger at a slow pace. The speed is             'frameRate(10)' . Default was frameRate(24).   
- COLOR:  I choose a peach color for the bubbles. And when you hover, it becomes a darker pink color. 
- NUMBER: The number of bubbles is 30.
