1. What do the numbers inside the parentheses after a function name do?
      The numbers inside the parentheses are called argument. The argument(numbers) execute the function. 
      If I do a function CreatCanvas(400, 300), it means the canvas is 400px wide and 300px high. 

2. What’s the difference between fill and stroke?
      Fill describes the interior of the shape, and the stroke describes the outline of the shape. 
      For instance, if you do fill(0,0,255), it will show a blue color inside of the shape. 
      'nostroke' function means no outline. 'strokeweight(1)' this means stroke weight is 1px. 
    
3. The P5 web editor has a built-in console — but it turns out that Chrome also has a console to display errors. 
   Do some googling to find out how you can open the Chrome console. Then, try to find a website that has errors 
   — visit a website, open the console, and see if there are any red-highlighted items. 
   Take a screenshot and upload it into your repository.
      
      Click the right mouse and then click inspect. There is a menu called console.
